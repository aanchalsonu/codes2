/*
Chef is playing a game with his friend Misha. They have a pile containg N coins. Players take alternate turns, removing some coins from the pile.
On each turn, a player can remove either one coin or coins equal to some prime power (i.e. px coins, where p - prime number and x - positive integer).
Game ends when the pile becomes empty. The player who can not make a move in his turn loses.

Chef plays first. Your task is to find out who will win the game, provided that both of the player play optimally.
