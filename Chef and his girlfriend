/*
One day Chef is waiting his girlfriend on the bus station. The girlfriend said that she will be at time1. Chef went to the bus station at time2. When Chef has 
reached the bus station he realized that he forgot a gift for his better half in his home.
Chef knows that someone can reach his home in dist minutes (his girlfriend also needs dist minutes to get Chef's home after she arrived at the bus station). So, 
Chef came up with two plans for present the gift:

i. The first one is to wait for his girlfriend at the bus station. And then go to the home together with her. When Chef and his girlfriend will reach the home he 
will present his gift.

ii. The second one is to call the girlfriend and ask her to go to his home when she will reach the bus station. And after calling he will go to the home, take
the gift, and go towards the girlfriend. When they meet each other he will present his gift (they can meet at any position of the road or at the bus station). 
It's known that girlfriend and Chef uses the same road between bus station and Chef's home.

Please, help Chef to estimate the time in minutes for each of his plans.
