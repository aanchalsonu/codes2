/*Limak is a little polar bear, who loves eating cookies and drinking milk. For this reason he often visits Chef's kitchen.

Limak is going to spend N minutes in the kitchen. Each minute he either eats a cookie or drinks milk. Cookies are very sweet and thus Limak's parents have instructed him, that after eating a cookie, he has to drink milk in the next minute.

You are given whether he ate a cookie or drank milk in each of the N minutes. Your task is to check if Limak followed his parents' instructions. That is, you need to verify whether after each eaten cookie he drinks milk in the next minute. Print "YES" or "NO" for each test case accordingly.
