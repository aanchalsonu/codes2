/*

There are 
�
N friends who decided to play the game of musical chairs one day.

Initially they decide a number 
�
K and with each passing round they remove exactly 
�
K chairs. Hence, in each round exactly 
�
K players are eliminated. The game stops when less than or exactly 
�
K players remain in the game.

Now, Chef wants to figure out for how many possible values of 
�
K there will be exactly one winner in the game.

Input Format
The first line contains 
�
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contain 
�
N - the number of friends in the game.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line a integer that denotes the number of values of 
�
K for which there will be exactly one winner.
