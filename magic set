/*
Katya has a sequence of integers 
�
1
,
�
2
,
…
,
�
�
a 
1
​
 ,a 
2
​
 ,…,a 
n
​
  and an integer 
�
m.

She defines a good sequence of integers as a non-empty sequence such that the sum of the elements in each of its non-empty subsequences is divisible by 
�
m.

Katya wants to know the number of good subsequences of the sequence 
�
a. Can you help her?

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 
�
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
�
T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 
�
n and 
�
m.
The second line contains 
�
n space-separated integers 
�
1
,
�
2
,
…
,
�
�
a 
1
​
 ,a 
2
​
 ,…,a 
n
​
 .
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of good subsequences.
