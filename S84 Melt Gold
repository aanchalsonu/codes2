/*
Chef has an ore with melting point of 
�
X degrees.
Chef’s kiln has a initial temperature of 
�
Y degrees. The temperature of the kiln increases by 
�
i degrees after the 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  minute.

Find the minimum time in minutes after which the ore starts melting.

Note:

We are only concerned about the temperature at the end of each minute and not during a minute.
The ore starts melting if the temperature of the kiln becomes greater than or equal to the melting point.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
�
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
�
X and 
�
Y — the melting point of the ore and the initial temperature of kiln.
