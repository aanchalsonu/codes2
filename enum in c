//facts about enum 
/* 1. enum is used to give names to integral constants
2. enum can be declared anywhere in the program 
3. enum will hold only integral constants 
4. there is no need to assisgn values to the constants as enum will do automatic initialization 
5. no float values are allowed 
6. there should not be any two enums with the same member name in the same scope 
7. Enum will initialize the next member with the value of previous member +1
