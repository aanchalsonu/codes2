/*

Sheokand is good at mathematics. One day, to test his math skills, Kaali gave him an integer  To impress Kaali, Sheokand has to convert 
into an integer M that can be represented in the form   (where x and y are non-negative integers such that. In order to do that, he can
perform two types of operations:
add 1 to n 
substract 1 from n
However, Sheokand is preparing for his exams. Can you help him find the minimum number of operations required to convert N into a valid integer

#include <iostream>
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	
	long int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    long long n,x=1000000001,s;
	    int a[32];
	    
	    cin>>n;
	    for(int i=0;i<32;i++){a[i]=pow(2,i);}
	   for(int i=0;i<32;i++){for(int j=i+1;j<32;j++)
	     {s=a[i]+a[j];x=min(x,abs(s-n));}
	   }
	   cout<<x<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}


THE LOGIC IS FIRST CALCULATE THE WHOLE 'a' ARRAY WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE POWER VALUES 
NOW START ITERATING IT ANS FIND THE MINIMUM VALUE
WHICH IS THE ANSWER
