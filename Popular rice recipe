/*
Did you know that there are over 40,000 varieties of Rice in the world ? There are so many dishes that can be prepared with Rice too. 
A famous chef from Mumbai, Tid Gusto prepared a new dish and named it 'Tid Rice'. He posted the recipe in his newly designed blog for community voting,
where a user can plus (+) or minus (-) the recipe. The final score is just the sum of all votes, where (+) and (-) are treated as +1 and -1 respectively.
But, being just a chef ( and not a codechef ) he forgot to take care of multiple votes by the same user.

A user might have voted multiple times and Tid is worried that the final score shown is not the correct one. Luckily, he found the user logs,
which had all the N votes in the order they arrived. Remember that, if a user votes more than once, the user's previous vote is first nullified before 
the latest vote is counted ( see explanation for more clarity ). Given these records in order ( and being a codechef yourself :) ),
calculate the correct final score.
