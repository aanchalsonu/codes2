/*
There are NN students in a class. Recently, an exam on Advanced Algorithms was conducted with maximum score MM and minimum score 00. The 
average score of the class was found out to be exactly XX.

Given that a student having score strictly greater than the average receives an A grade, find the maximum number of students that can receive an A grade.
