Consider an array A having length N such that 1≤i≤N.
You are given an integer array 1≤i≤N.

We create another array C of length Let the number of subarrays of C having sum strictly greater than P andLet the number of subarrays of C
having sum strictly less than Determine the value of ∣x∣ denotes the absolute value of X is a subarray of an array X can be obtained from  by 
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
