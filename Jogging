/*
Alice jogs everyday to keep herself fit and active. She noticed that she burns 
�
X calories when jogging the first kilometer, and for 
�
>
1
K>1, jogging the 
�
�
ℎ
K 
th
  kilometer burns calories equivalent to the total number of calories burned while jogging the first 
�
−
1
K−1 kilometers.

What is the total number of calories that Alice burns after jogging for 
�
N kilometers? The answer can be very large, so report it modulo 
1
0

 +7 (
1000000007
1000000007).

Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer 
�
T — the number of test cases. The description of 
�
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers 
�
N and 
�
X, as described in the problem statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the total number of calories that Alice burns after jogging for 
�
N kilometers, modulo
