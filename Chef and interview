/*
Chef wants to hire a new assistant. He published an advertisement regarding that in a newspaper. After seeing the advertisement, many candidates have
applied for the job. Now chef wants to shortlist people for the interviews, so he gave all of them one problem which they must solve in order to get 
shortlisted.

The problem was : For a given positive integer N, what is the maximum sum of distinct numbers such that the Least Common Multiple of all these numbers is N.

Your friend Rupsa also applied for the job, but was unable to solve this problem and hence you've decided to help her out by writing a code for 
solving this problem.

#include <iostream>
#include<boost/math/common_factor.hpp> // for LCM function 
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	long int t,n,i,r;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--)
	{
	    cin>>n;
	    r=0;
	    for(i=1;i*i<=n;i++) //to compute till half of n value
	    {
	        if(n%i == 0) // for computing LCM it should be multiple for sure so first check for the number to be multiple of n 
	        {
	            if(n/i == i) // if it the number itself then just add it 
	            {
	                r += i;
	            }
	            else // which means it  has 2 factors such as 4 and 1 for n =4
	            {
	                r+=(n/i)+i;
	            }
	        }
