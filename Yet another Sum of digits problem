Ujan is a software developer. He is developing a software that takes two integers 
�
L and 
�
R and outputs the count of integers in the sequence

+

,
…
,
�
−
1
,
�
L,L+1,…,R−1,R whose sum of digits (SOD) is divisible by 
3
3.

He has developed the user interface (UI) quite easily. He is having a hard time finding the logic to solve the problem. As you are not only a good friend of Ujan but also a good problem solver, he asks you to help him out.

Can you solve the problem for your friend, Ujan?
