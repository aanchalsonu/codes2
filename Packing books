/*
Chef is moving to a new house!

Unfortunately, this means he now has to pack up his things so that they can be moved too. Currently, Chef is packing up his (rather impressive) book

collection into cardboard boxes.

Chef has XX shelves of books, each of which contains exactly YY books. Each cardboard box can hold at most ZZ books. In order to not mess up the organization 
of the books, Chef will also ensure that books from different shelves will not be placed in the same box.

Under these conditions, what is the minimum number of boxes needed to pack all the books?
