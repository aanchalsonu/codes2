/*
Asim has performed some challenges from day  to day . For each day after completing the challenge, he earns some grade points and stores them in an array simultaneously.

Your task is to find for each day, the closest day before the current day on which he earned lesser grade point.

If he earns no lesser grade point as compared to the present day then print  for that day.
