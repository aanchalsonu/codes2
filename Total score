/*There are 
�
K problems in a contest with 
�
N participants. All the problems don't necessarily have the same points assigned to them - you are given an array 
�
A of integers, where 
�
�
A 
i
​
  denotes the points assigned to the 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  problem. If a participant solves the 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  problem, they will get 
�
�
A 
i
​
  points added to their total score. Note that there are no partial points - they can get only 
0
0 or 
�
�
A 
i
​
  points on the 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  problem. For each participant 
�
i, you are also given their final verdict in each problem in the form of a binary string 
�
�
S 
i
​
  - a 
1
1 denotes that they solved that problem, and a 
0
0 denotes that they did not.

Your job is to find the total score of each participant.

###Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer 
�
T, denoting the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains 
2
2 space separated integers, 
�
N and 
�
K, denoting the number of participants and the number of problems in the contest respectively.
The second line contains 
�
K space separated integers - 
�
1
,
�
2
,
…
,
�
�
A 
1
​
 ,A 
2
​
 ,…,A 
K
​
 , where 
�
�
A 
i
​
  denotes the points assigned to the 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  problem.
The 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  of the next 
�
N lines contains a binary string 
�
�
S 
i
​
  of length 
�
K, where 
�
�
�
S 
ij
​
  represents the verdict of the 
�
�
ℎ
j 
th
  problem for 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  participant. 
�
�
�
=
1
S 
ij
​
 =1 if they solved that problem, and 
�
�
�
=
0
S 
ij
​
 =0 otherwise.
###Output: For each testcase, output 
�
N lines, with the 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  line containing a single integer denoting the total score of the 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  participant.
