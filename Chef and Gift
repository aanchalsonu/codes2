/*
Today is chef's friend's birthday. He wants to give a gift to his friend. So he was desperately searching for some gift here and there.

Fortunately, he found an array a of size n lying around. The array contains positive integers. Chef's friend likes even numbers very much. So for the gift, 
chef will choose a consecutive non-empty segment of the array. The segment should contain exactly k even integers. Though it can have any number of odd integers.
He will then pick that segment and gift it to his friend.

But there is a problem. It might not be always possible for the chef to choose such a segment. Please tell whether it is possible for chef to select some gift or not?
