/*
Edward Elric is chasing after Scar. To stop Edward, Scar creates NN barriers in the way, numbered from 11 to NN. Each barrier Scar created is either one of the 
following two types.

Type 1 barrier - This barrier starts from a height XX above the ground and extends till the sky.
Type 2 barrier - This barrier starts from the ground and extends up to height XX above the ground.

The height of Edward is HH units and he has an alchemic life force of LL units. Moreover, he can duck by Y_{1}Y 
1
​
  units and jump by height Y_{2}Y 
2
​
  units (as explained in the figures). He starts crossing barriers in sequence, starting from barrier 11 till the barrier NN. Whenever he can't pass a barrier by 
  ducking or jumping (considered passed even when the barrier just touches him), he uses Alchemy to break the barrier. However, this costs him a single unit of his
  alchemic life force.

If after breaking a barrier no life force is left, Edward gets completely exhausted, unable to pass that barrier.
How many barriers can Edward cross?

And remember never to call him a pipsqueak if his height is too short!
