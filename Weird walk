/*
Alice and Bob are walking on an infinite straight street. Initially, both are at the position X=0X=0 and they start walking in the direction of increasing XX.
After NN seconds, they stop. Let's denote Alice's speed and Bob's speed during the ii-th of these seconds by A_iA 
i and B_iB respectively.

Sometimes, Alice and Bob walk together, i.e. with the same speed side by side. Let's define the weird distance as the total distance they walk this way. 
Find this weird distance.
