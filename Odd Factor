/*
Frank has been assigned a math problem , Frank has an integer . Check if  has an odd divisor greater than one , more formally does there exist a number  (>1) such that  is divisible by  and  is odd.

For example if  = , then the divisors are { , , ,  } so there is x =  which is Odd and Greater than one . if  = , then such a number does not exist.
