/*

Alice and Bob are two friends. Initially, the skill levels of them are zero. They work on alternative days, i.e one of Alice and Bob works on the odd-numbered days
(
1
,
3
,
5
,
…
 
)
(1,3,5,…) and the other works on the even-numbered days 
(
2
,
4
,
6
,
…
 
)
(2,4,6,…). The skill levels of Alice and Bob increase by 
�
,
�
A,B respectively on the days they work.

Determine if it is possible that the skill levels of Alice and Bob become exactly 
�
,
�
P,Q respectively on some day.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
�
T, denoting the number of test cases. The 
�
T test cases then follow:
The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers 
�
,
�
,
�
,
�
A,B,P,Q.
Output Format
For each test case, print YES if it is possible that the skill levels of Alice and Bob become exactly 
�
,
�
P,Q on some day, otherwise print NO.
