You are an administrator of a popular quiz website. Every day, you hold a quiz on the website.

There are n users (numbered i to n) and admins numbered from n+1 to m ) For each quiz, each user is allowed to attempt it at most once. 
Sometimes, admins attempt the quizzes for testing purposes too; an admin may attempt a quiz any number of times.
On a certain day, the quiz was attempted and k attempts were made 
 . Find all the users who attempted the quiz more than once, in order to disqualify them.
