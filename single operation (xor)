/*Chef has the binary representation SS of a number XX with him. He can modify the number by applying the following operation exactly once:
make x  = x XOR (x/2^y) 
Chef wants to maximize the value of XX after performing the operation. Help Chef in determining the value of YY which will maximize the value of XX after the operation.
 For maximizing perform right shift of the binary representation of the number till the 1st  zero is encountered , the value right shifted by y times will give the maximum value of x 
 where y is equal to position of 1st zero
