/*
Chef has two integers AA and BB.
Chef wants to find the minimum value of \texttt{lcm}(A, X) - \texttt{gcd}(B, X)lcm(A,X)âˆ’gcd(B,X) where XX is any positive integer.

Help him determine this value.

Note: \texttt{gcd}(P, Q)gcd(P,Q) denotes the greatest common divisor of PP and QQ and \texttt{lcm}(P, Q)lcm(P,Q) denotes the least common multiple of PP and QQ.
