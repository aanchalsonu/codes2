/*
There are NN cars (numbered 11 through NN) on a circular track with length NN. For each ii (2 \le i \le N2≤i≤N), the ii-th of them is at a distance i-1i−1 
clockwise from car 11, i.e. car 11 needs to travel a distance i-1i−1 clockwise to reach car ii. Also, for each valid ii, the ii-th car has f_if 
i litres of gasoline in it initially.

You are driving car 11 in the clockwise direction. To move one unit of distance in this direction, you need to spend 11 litre of gasoline. When you pass 
another car (even if you'd run out of gasoline exactly at that point), you steal all its gasoline. Once you do not have any gasoline left, you stop.

What is the total clockwise distance travelled by your car?
