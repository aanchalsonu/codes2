/*Triangle classification is an important problem in modern mathematics. Mathematicians have developed many criteria according to which a triangle can be classified.
In this problem, you will be asked to classify some triangles according to their sides and angles.

According to their measure, angles may be:

Acute — an angle that is less than 90 degrees
Right — a 90-degrees angle
Obtuse — an angle that is greater than 90 degrees
According to their sides, triangles may be:

Scalene — all sides are different
Isosceles — exactly two sides are equal
According to their angles, triangles may be:

Acute — all angles are acute
Right — one angle is right
Obtuse — one angle is obtuse
Triangles with three equal sides (equilateral triangles) will not appear in the test data.

The triangles formed by three collinear points are not considered in this problem. In order to classify a triangle, you should use only the adjactives
from the statement. There is no triangle which could be described in two different ways according to the classification characteristics considered above.
