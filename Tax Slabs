/*n India, every individual is charged with income tax on the total income each year. This tax is applied to specific ranges of income, which are called 
income tax slabs. The slabs of income tax keep changing from year to year. 
This fiscal year (2020-21), the tax slabs and their respective tax rates are as follows:

Total income (in rupees)	Tax rate
up to Rs. 250,000	0%
from Rs. 250,001 to Rs. 500,000	5%
from Rs. 500,001 to Rs. 750,000	10%
from Rs. 750,001 to Rs. 1,000,000	15%
from Rs. 1,000,001 to Rs. 1,250,000	20%
from Rs. 1,250,001 to Rs. 1,500,000	25%
above Rs. 1,500,000	30%
See the sample explanation for details on how the income tax is calculated.

You are given Chef's total income: NN rupees (Rs.). Find his net income. The net income is calculated by subtracting the total tax (also called tax reduction) 
from the total income. Note that you do not need to worry about any other kind of tax reductions, only the one described above.
